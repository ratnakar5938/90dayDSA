2D Array ▶️
    A 2D Array is a combination of 1D arrays used to store tabular data.
    ▶️ The representation of 2D array is of tabular form but the memory allocation inside stack/heap are in linear form
    ▶️ Accessing the values inside an 2D array is similar to that of 1D array
    Eg -> Accessing 3rd element from the 2nd row -> A[1][2]; -> A[R][E] -> R is row number and E is element number
    ▶️ Creating array ->
        1. int A[x][y]; -> x and y are integers
        2. int A[3][4] = {{*,*,*,*},{*,*,*,*},{*,*,*,*}} -> * are integer data

        3. int *A[x]; -> array of pointers to point to their respective memory in heap
           for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) 
           {
               A[i] = new int[y];  -> this will create memory for the 2D array in heap 
           }

        4. int **A;
           A = new *int[x];
           for(int i = 0; i < x; i++) 
           {
               A[i] = new int[y];
           }

    ▶️ To traverse inside a 2D array we use nested for-loop
