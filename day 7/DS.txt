Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Note =>
Data structure and data types are slightly different. Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.

Types of DS =>
    1. Linear DS (elements are arranged in sequence one after the other)
    2. Non-linear DS (elements are not in any sequence)

Linear DS =>
    1. Array -> elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory
    2. Stack -> elements are stored in the LIFO principle
    3. Queue -> data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first
    4. LinkedList -> data elements are connected through a series of nodes

Non-linear DS => 
    1. Graph -> each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges
    2. Tree -> in this data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices
