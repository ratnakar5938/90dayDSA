1. About Main memory
2. How a program use memory
3. Static allocation
4. Dynamic allocation

Static versus dynamic memory allocation so for that we should understand memory so memory is divided into smaller addressable unit that is called as bytes.

int a = 5; or int a; --> Static allocation

void fun2(int i)
{
    int a;
}
void fun()
{
    int x;
    fun2(x);
}
void main()
{
    int a;
    float b;

    fun();
    return 0;
}

main {a,b} --> fun {x} --> fun2 {i, a} // sequence of formation and inverse sequence of destroying
this works like a stack {LIFO principle} that is y it is called stack.
