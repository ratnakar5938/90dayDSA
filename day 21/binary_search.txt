Binary Search ▶️
    ▶️ The prerequisite for binary search is that the given array must be sorted.
    ▶️ To perform binary search we need three indices -> lower, higher and mid
        mid = (low + higher)/2
        low -> initial element of the list
        higher -> last element of the list
    ▶️ On every step we divide the list into two halves and we reject the part of list that doesn't contain the element.
