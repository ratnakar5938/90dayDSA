Head Recursion ▶️
▶️ If in a recursion the recursive call is the first statement in the function then it is called tail recursion.
▶️ All execution will be done at the returning time and nothing is done at the calling time.

eg.
    type function( params )
    {
        if( condition )
        {
            function( params );
            // code to be executed afterwards
        }
    }

Head Recursion VS Loops 

▶️ If a recursion have to do something in the returning phase of the function then it cannot be converted to loops directly.

head recursion ▶️
    void fun(int n)
    {
        if(n>0)
        {
            fun(n-1);
            cout<<n<<endl;
        }
    }

loop ▶️
    void fun(int n)
    {
        int i = 1;
        while(i<=n)
        {
            cout<<i<<endl;
            i++;
        }
    }
