1. What is recursion?

Type fun(param)
{
    if (base condition)
    {
        //code
        fun(param);
    }
    else
    {
        //code
    }
}

A function calls itself inside the function is called a recursive function and this method is called recursion.
There must be a base condition that will terminate recursion so that it won't go infinitely.
