Generalising Recursion ▶️

    Type function(params)
    {
        if(base condition)
        {
            1. statement to be executed before calling // Ascending
            2. function(params)
            3. statement to be executed after returning // Descending
        }
    }

▶️ Difference between recursion and loop is that Loop will only have ascending phase while recursion have both ascending and descending phase.
